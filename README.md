# üí° **What we solve**

Many people tend to have multiple startups as their organization, we intend to provide them with a single platform from where they can manage their organizations and their employees.
We provide them with features like employee management, department management, salary payment, etc.
Also, the user need not be able to know how wallets like metamask work and be confused. We use the banana wallet, which provides users with an easy way to transact. This adds an extra security measure as well as provides an ease to the user.

- Organisation can pay their employees with just one click after connecting the hardware key.
